## Overview

This example demonstrates how to use Coala to perform query-driven Hi-C analysis, including visualizing chromatin contact maps, calculating expected cis-contacts and compartment profiles, visualizing compartmentalization with saddle plots, and identifying boundaries between topologically associating domains. 

The details of this example are available at [Coala website](https://coala.info/use-cases/Hi-C.html).

This analysis requires the following input data:
- [test.mcool](#mcool): A multi-resolution mcool file containing Micro-C data for chromosomes 2 and 17 of HFF cell line.
- The accompanying view BED [view_hg38.tsv](#view), bin interval [bins.100000.tsv](#bin) and GC content track [gc.100000.tsv](#gc).

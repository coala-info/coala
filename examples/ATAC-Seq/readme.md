## Overview

This example demonstrates how to use Coala to perform query-driven ATAC-Seq analysis, including peak calling using MACS3, peak annotation using ChIPseeker, and peak visualization using pyGenomeTracks.

The details of this example are available at [Coala website](https://coala.info/use-cases/ATAC-Seq.html).

This analysis requires the following input data:
- [BT549_Doxminus_chr22.bam](#bt549): Human ATAC-Seq data from the BT-549 human triple negative breast cancer cell line (GSE180599), using only the reads mapped to chromosome 22.

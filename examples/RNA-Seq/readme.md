## Overview

This example demonstrates how to use Coala to perform query-driven RNA-Seq analysis: downloading data from GEO, describing study design information, performing differential gene expression (DEG) analysis, downloading curated gene sets from MSigDB, running Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) with canonical pathways, and generating enrichment plots for specified pathways. 

The details of this example are available at [Coala website](https://coala.info/use-cases/RNA-Seq.html).

# Coala: Command-line LLM-agent Adapter


## Introduction

Coala is a standards-based framework for turning command-line tools into reproducible, agent-accessible toolsets that support natural-language interaction.

Coala integrates the [Common Workflow Language (CWL)](https://www.commonwl.org/specification/) with the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) to standardize tool execution. This approach allows Large Language Model (LLM) agents to discover and run tools through structured interfaces, while strictly enforcing the containerized environments and deterministic results necessary for reproducible science.

Please find Coala documuentations through [Coala website](https://coala.info/), including [overview](https://coala.info/guide/), [installation](https://coala.info/guide/installation.html), [quick start](https://coala.info/guide/quick-start.html), and [use cases](https://coala.info/use-cases/).
